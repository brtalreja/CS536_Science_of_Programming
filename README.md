## Introduction to Science of Programming

The course began with an introduction to the foundational principles of the science of programming, focusing on the importance of program correctness and verification.

## Propositional Logic

Studied the basics of propositional logic, including logical connectives, truth tables, and logical equivalences, which are fundamental in formal reasoning about programs.

## Predicate Logic

Explored predicate logic, quantifiers, and their applications in specifying and reasoning about properties of programs.

## State Update and Substitution

Learned about state update and substitution mechanisms, essential for understanding the behavior of programs during execution.

## Expressions and Types

Covered the evaluation of expressions and the role of types in ensuring program correctness.

## Statements and Operational Semantics

Examined the operational semantics of programming statements and how they describe the execution of programs.

## Big-step Semantics

Introduced big-step semantics to model the overall effect of executing program statements.

## Divergence and Runtime Errors

Discussed concepts of program divergence, non-termination, and runtime errors, and how they impact program correctness.

## Hoare Triples I, II, and III

Learned about Hoare triples for reasoning about program correctness, including partial correctness, total correctness, and their formal proofs.

## Proofs and Proof Outlines

Studied various proof techniques and proof outlines to systematically verify program properties.

## Weakest Preconditions I and II

Explored the concept of weakest preconditions, which help in deriving conditions that ensure a program meets its specification.

## Strongest Postconditions

Investigated strongest postconditions for reasoning about the outcomes of program execution.

## Loop Invariants I and II

Learned about loop invariants and their critical role in verifying the correctness of iterative programs.

## Proof Outlines and Loop Bounds

Studied proof outlines and techniques for establishing loop bounds, ensuring that loops terminate correctly.

## Array Assignments

Covered the verification of array assignments and reasoning about their correctness.

## Pointers and Local Reasoning

Explored pointers and local reasoning, focusing on the challenges they pose for program verification.

## Separation Logic

Introduced separation logic, a powerful tool for reasoning about programs with pointers and mutable data structures.

## Sequential Nondeterminism

Discussed sequential nondeterminism and its implications for program behavior and verification.

## Parallel Program Basics

Covered the basics of parallel programming, including concepts of concurrency and synchronization.

## Concurrent Separation Logic

Studied concurrent separation logic for reasoning about concurrent programs and ensuring their correctness.

## Verification with Dafny

Explored the Dafny verification language, a practical tool for automated program verification and formal proof construction.
